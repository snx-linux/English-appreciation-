                <p>The poem "Indian Weavers" is simple yet rich in meaning. It is like a conversation between the speaker and the weavers. It uses symbolism to compare the cloth woven by weavers to the stages of human life. The use of colors like blue, purple, and white creates vivid pictures and emotions. The question-answer format gives the poem a rhythmic and engaging quality. The poem beautifully connects Indian culture and tradition with universal themes of life and death.</p>

            <div class="info-section">
                <h3>About the Poet</h3>
                <p>It is written by Robert Southey. He was a famous English poet of the Romantic age. He also served as the Poet Laureate of England from 1813 to 1843.</p>
                <p><strong>Rhyme Scheme:</strong> The rhyme scheme of the poem is AABB.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-section">
                <h3>Theme & Central Idea</h3>
                <p><strong>Theme:</strong> The poem is a ballad (a narrative poem) based on a Scottish legend. It tells the story of Sir Ralph, whose evil act leads to his own destruction. Sir Robert Southey gives a strong moral message through simple language and a powerful story.</p>
                <p><strong>Central Idea:</strong> The central idea of the poem is "As you sow, so shall you reap". It highlights the concept of poetic justice, where Sir Ralph, out of jealousy, removes the warning bell from the dangerous Inchcape Rock but later becomes a victim of his own wickedness when his ship crashes into the same rock.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-section">
                <h3>Figures of Speech</h3>
                <p>There are many figures of speech used in the poem, like Alliteration and Personification (e.g., "The sun in heaven was shining gay").</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-section">
                <h3>Special Features</h3>
                <p>The poem is written in a narrative style with a clear moral message. It uses vivid imagery and personification to create strong visual effects. The use of dialogue and suspense makes the poem engaging. The language is simple and yet powerful. The use of the rhyme scheme adds a musical quality. It also uses contrast—between the good Abbot and the evil Sir Ralph—to make the message clear.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-section">
                <h3>Message</h3>
                <p>The poem gives the moral that evil actions eventually lead to one's downfall. It teaches us that jealousy, greed, and cruelty lead to destruction, while good deeds are remembered and respected.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-section">
                <h3>Personal Opinion</h3>
                <p>I liked the poem because of its strong storytelling style. The ending is satisfying and teaches an important lesson in an enjoyable way. The use of poetic devices made the poem powerful.</p>
